    Time Complexity: O(n log n)

    Intuition:
    * rrder first then add the rest later

    Approach:
    * Prioritize the order array first so iterate it first
    * We'll use the frequency of each characters from the s to add to the ans 
      (since the order is unique)
    * Next, iterate the REST of the characters in array s (sorted)
