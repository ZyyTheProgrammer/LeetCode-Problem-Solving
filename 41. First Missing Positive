Time complexity: O(n)

Intuition:

* utilize the range as a replacement to sort
* use the hash set to when using a membership operator to provide the O(1) time complexity

Approach: 

use the highest number from the array to create the length of the range starting from 1,
from that range, if the number is not in the array, then it is the smallest positive.
if all number appears in the array, the return the highest number + 1
if the highest number is a negative, then return 1
